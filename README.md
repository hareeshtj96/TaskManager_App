# TaskManager_App

TaskManager_App is a full-stack to-do application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, designed to help users effectively manage their tasks. This app allows users to log in using Google Sign-In for quick and secure access. Once logged in, users can create, edit, view, and delete tasks. Task statuses are easily organized through a drag-and-drop functionality that enables users to move tasks across different status categories—such as TODO, IN_PROGRESS, and DONE—with changes reflected instantly. This feature is implemented using the React DnD library, providing a smooth and intuitive experience.

To set up TaskManager_App, clone the repository, install dependencies in both the frontend and backend (cd frontend && npm install, cd backend && npm install), then start the application by running npm run dev in the frontend directory and npm start in the backend directory.
